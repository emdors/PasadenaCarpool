        h1 What does the Czar do

        p The Czar's job is to look at all of the user's preferences and create a schedule for the week. When you are creating the schedule, you have to balance many different competing priorities. Here is an ordered list of priorities to consider:
        ol
          li Individual constraints come first. Once in a while if you really really want to violate a constraint, email/call the person to check if that is ok.
          li Minimize number of cars required.
          li Individual preferences come next (e.g. preferences to leave a certain time or to drive or not to drive).
          li Balance cumulative driving statistics so that everyone has roughly the same driving percentage. (Refer to the statistics page for the semester.)
          li Avoid someone driving home alone from 3:30-6:30pm because of heavy traffic in the late afternoon/evening to Pasadena. That allows the person to use carpool lane.
          li Avoid someone driving too many times in one week if possible.
          li Group people who are from the same campus for convenience of drop off in AM/pick up in PM.
          li Cars can go solo in the morning and that saves a trip to the carpool spot, so try to let cars go solo in the AM.
          li Balance cars so they are not too squished (some cars can seat 5 comfortably).

        h1 How do you make a schedule / use the Czar tools?
        
        p The first step in this tutorial is to get familiar with the Czar page enviroment. Notice that there are two tables with gray and blue boxes. The left table corresponds to individual's AM time preferences and the right table corresponds to individual's PM time preferences.. In these tables the blue boxes represent times where a user has indicated they are willing to leave at while the gray boxes represent times in which the user does not want to leave. 

        p To make a new car, click on the 'Make New Car' button underneath each day's AM time box.  This will create a visual of a car, with spaces for both AM and PM passengers.  If you want to delete a car, click the 'X' at the top right to remove it (Note: this will also remove any passengers you may have added).
        
        p Click anywhere on a passengers row, and drag onto the desired space in the car.  Note that if you drag the AM row of a person, you cannot drop it in the PM section of the car.  Once you have added someone to the car, the button to the left of their name will make them the car's driver and the 'X' to the right will remove them from the car.

        p This tool is really usefull for adding cars and allows you to make a complete car if you also decide to fill in the right column. An important thing to note is that this tool can only be used to make new cars and not to add on to existing ones. If you want to add onto existing ones you will have to delete the existing one, use the tool and then re add the other side. When you are done using this tool press the "close" button to make it go away.

        p To finish and submit a car to the final schedule, click the 'Finish Car' button at the bottom of the car you want to finish.  It can be reopened using the 'Edit Car' button if you want to go back and change an already submitted car.

        h1 Czar Tool Tips

        p Even after going through the czar tools tutorial it stay not be clear what is the best way to go about how to make use of these tools, especially if you already have experience Czaring by hand. My advise to you is to just start by selecting a random group of people in the morning to add to a car and then look at the table in the pm and see if that selection leads to a group of people that would go well in a car together in the evening. These tools where designed not to help with a methodical approch, but rather to make the work of guesssing and checking very easy so that you can try many different combinations quickly. 

        p Many people prefer to start with the most restrictive times and work forward from that.  It is important to pay attention to the drivers, as the same person needs to be the driver for both AM and PM.
